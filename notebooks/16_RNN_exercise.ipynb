    "## Fun Exercise: Bach Chorales\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: This exercise, which is about create a model that is able to compose J. S. Bach like chorales, has been heavily influenced by [Google's Coconet model](https://homl.info/coconet), which was used for a nice [Google doodle about Bach](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach).\n",
    "The helper functions are from A. Géron \n",
    "\n",
    "The Bach chorales dataset is composed of 382 chorales composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. Each chorale is 100 to 640 time steps long, and each time step contains 4 integers, where each integer corresponds to a note's index on a piano (except for the value 0, which means that no note is played). Train a model—recurrent, convolutional, or both—that can predict the next time step (four notes), given a sequence of time steps from a chorale. Then use this model to generate Bach-like music, one note at a time: you can do this by giving the model the start of a chorale and asking it to predict the next time step, then appending these time steps to the input sequence and asking the model for the next note, and so on. Also make sure to check out [Google's Coconet model](https://homl.info/coconet), which was used for a nice [Google doodle about Bach](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach)._\n",

    "In order to be able to generate new chorales, we want to train a model that can predict the next chord given all the previous chords. If we naively try to predict the next chord in one shot, predicting all 4 notes at once, we run the risk of getting notes that don't go very well together. It's much better and simpler to predict one note at a time. So we will need to preprocess every chorale, turning each chord into an arpegio (i.e., a sequence of notes rather than notes played simultaneuously). So each chorale will be a long sequence of notes (rather than chords), and we can just train a model that can predict the next note given all the previous notes. We will use a sequence-to-sequence approach, where we feed a window to the neural net, and it tries to predict that same window shifted one time step into the future.\n",

Conversely, if you replace a C3 with a C\\#3, it's very likely that the chord will sound horrible, despite these notes being just next to each other. So we will use an `Embedding` layer to convert each note to a small vector representation. We will use 5-dimensional embeddings, so the output of this first layer will have a shape of `[batch_size, window_size, 5]`.\n",

In addition the Conv1D layers will have doubling dilatation rates (1, 2, 4, 8). We will intersperse these layers with `BatchNormalization` layers for faster and better convergence.\n",

    "This approach has one major flaw: it is often too conservative. Indeed, the model will not take any risk, it will always choose the note with the highest score, and since repeating the previous note generally sounds good enough, it's the least risky option, so the algorithm will tend to make notes last longer and longer. Pretty boring. Plus, if you run the model multiple times, it will always generate the same melody.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's spice things up a bit! Instead of always picking the note with the highest score, we will pick the next note randomly, according to the predicted probabilities. For example, if the model predicts a C3 with 75% probability, and a G3 with a 25% probability, then we will pick one of these two notes randomly, with these probabilities. We will also add a `temperature` parameter that will control how \"hot\" (i.e., daring) we want the system to feel. A high temperature will bring the predicted probabilities closer together, reducing the probability of the likely notes and increasing the probability of the unlikely ones."
